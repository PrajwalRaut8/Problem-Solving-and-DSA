#Initialize Pointers: Set three pointers - low for 0s, mid for processing, and high for 2s.

#Loop through Array: Start iterating with mid from the beginning.

#Comparison:

#If arr[mid] is 0, swap arr[low] and arr[mid], increment low and mid.
#If arr[mid] is 1, move mid ahead.
#If arr[mid] is 2, swap arr[mid] and arr[high], decrement high.
#Termination: Repeat until mid surpasses or equals high.

#Result: The array becomes sorted with 0s on the left and 2s on the right.
